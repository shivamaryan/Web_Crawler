# Web_Crawler
Basic understanding of Web Crawler and implementing the same to extract data from Codeforces

1) Runs on python2 (python3 was giving lemons in importing of beautiful soup)
2) Uses the BeautifulSoup library of python for data extraction
This basically consists of 2 files.
The first one simply displays partial contents of the main page on Codeforces.

The second script however, goes to each of the webpage link of the rankers and displays some info from the webpage it just went to.

So all you need to do is type in your terminal python (filename).py

And VOILA!! see the magic of python :)
